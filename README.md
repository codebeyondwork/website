# Code Beyond Work

By day, I code in PHP and WordPress. These are the tools that got me into programming. However, I want to expand my coding chops. I needed a place to play with everything, which is where [Code Beyond Work](https://codebeyond.work) came into play.

I plan on adding at least 1 thing to the [changelog](changelog.md) every day.

A few rules:
1. No PHP allowed
    * It's my every day language and I know how to solve a lot of problems with it; it's a crutch. And I'm tired of using it.
1. All work must be done on the server
    * This means I don't have any GUI. I want to get back to running everything from the command line rather than relying on GUI software.
1. All work, both good and bad, should be publicly accessible
    * Why whitewash the painful, dumb bits? I am most assuredly fallible.
