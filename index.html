        <h1>Code Beyond Work</h1>
        <p>Hi! You can call me <strong>J</strong>, k? By day, I code primarily in PHP and WordPress. This is not so much fun. I fear that without a conscious effort on my part to seek out new tech, push my own boundaries, and work on my own projects, I am going to become obsolete. I am a donkey at work. It pays well but doesn't challenge me all that much (and anytime we get to play with new tech, I'm not the one that gets to play).</p>
        <p>So, this is going to be a living site. Today is Saturday, the last day of April in 2016 and I'm going to do everything live on the server. I'll commit everything to a repo and put that link in here when I get it all set up.</p>
        <p>I've got one rule - no PHP.</p>
        <p>Yours,<br>
        J</p>
